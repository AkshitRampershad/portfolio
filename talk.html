      <h2>EMPLOYING QUALITY ANALYSIS TOOLS AND TECHNOLOGIES TO PERFORM DATA ANALYSIS.</h2>
      <p style="text-align: justify;">
        As a Software Quality Engineer, I was involved in developing and testing the application, ensuring its reliability, functionality, and overall quality. Throughout the project, I worked closely with cross-functional teams, including developers, designers, and product managers, to ensure that the UKG Talk app met the highest software quality standards and user satisfaction. My primary focus was to apply quality assurance principles, testing techniques, and industry best practices to deliver a seamless and bug-free communication platform.
<br><br>
        <b>SQL:</b>
        I have utilized SQL queries to extract, transform, and analyze data from various databases supporting the app and performed data profiling and statistical analysis to identify trends, patterns, and anomalies in user behavior and engagement. I utilized SQL queries to retrieve relevant data from the organization's databases and perform data transformations using Python scripts. This integration has provides a seamless workflow for data analysis, eliminating the need to switch between multiple tools and systems and providing stakeholders with critical insights and findings. 
<br><br>
        <b>Test Automation using Selenium WebDriver</b>
        I have utilized Selenium WebDriver to conduct automated UI testing of our app and developed test scripts in Python to validate the app's user interface, ensuring proper functionality and responsiveness. I have executed test scenarios to identify UI issues, such as broken links, incorrect page rendering, or user input errors. I streamlined testing processes by developing automated test scripts and ensured efficient execution. Additionally, I leveraged Python libraries for data analysis, enabling in-depth examination and visualization of key metrics and performance indicators.
<br><br>
        <b>Usability Testing Analysis:</b>
        As a software quality engineer professional, I conduct usability testing sessions to evaluate applications' ease of use and adherence to UX guidelines. Analyzing user data helps me identify potential issues and improve overall user experience. Working with the development team, I provide data-driven recommendations and implement solutions to enhance usability and satisfaction. I enjoy contributing to user-friendly technology and meeting users' unique needs.
<br><br>
        <b>Collaboration</b>
        I utilized Confluence as a knowledge-sharing platform throughout the project to document data analysis processes, methodologies, and findings. I collaborated with the team, sharing data analysis techniques, insights, and best practices. Additionally, by integrating Jira with data analysis toolsets, I effectively managed and tracked data-related tasks, ensuring timely completion and effective coordination within the Agile development environment.
